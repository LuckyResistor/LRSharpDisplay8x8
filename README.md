# Sharp Display Driver 25x15 scaled x2

This is a very compact text based driver for the LS027B7DH01A display from Sharp using a fixed 8x8 pixel charset which is scaled x2 to 16x16 pixel. It has a minimal set of methods to write text on the screen. The main goal of this driver is to keep the memory footprint as low as possible.

Warning: This special version of the driver was never tested on real hardware.
